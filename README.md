# starfall-brix
A multiplayer block puzzle game written for the Starfall chip in Garry's Mod.

The actual code for the stacking puzzle game is in the `BRIX` object, which is all defined in `brix/core/*.lua` files.
Other planned gamemodes, such as Battle Royale Multiplayer, Singleplayer, or Local Multiplayer, will simply use this core game object, making slight changes for each mode.
This is a work in progress, so it is not ready for other people to use. Including `brix/core/core.lua` (provided you have the correct folder structure) will expose the base game object for creation.

If none of that makes sense to you, this code is not for you.
